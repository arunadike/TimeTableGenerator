# TimeTableGenerator
The Time Table Generation Project is a web-based solution designed to automate the creation of conflict-free schedules for educational institutions. Traditional timetable creation is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring manual balancing of classes, teachers, and room allocations. This project utilizes algorithms to consider constraints like teacher availability, room capacity, and subject requirements to generate optimal schedules. Administrators can input parameters, and the system will produce an efficient timetable, minimizing conflicts and maximizing resource utilization. The application also supports viewing, editing, and management of timetables, simplifying administrative tasks. This tool reduces workload, improves scheduling accuracy, and adapts to diverse institutional needs.
Here I use some of the terminology for creation of web pages, which include,
home.html --> Home Page,
departments,html --> Departments page ,
cse.html --> specifies to select the respective semester in the year for Computer Science and Engineering,
cse1.html --> specifies to give input that is no. of periods in the week for CSE 1st semester,
cse1o.html --> specifies to generate the output for corresponding inputs for CSE 1st semester,
be --> Bio Engineering,
ce --> Civil ENgineering,
che --> Chemical Engineering,
me --> Chemical ENgineering,
it --> Information Technology,
ee --> Electrical and Electronics Engineering,
ece --> Electronics and communication Engineering
